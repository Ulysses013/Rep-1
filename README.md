# Code Idea Description: Virtual Casino in Python

## Project Overview:

##### Hello! For the semester project, I am developing a small-scale **Virtual Casino** game in Python that offers three classic casino games: Blackjack, Roulette, and a Slot Machine. This project will not include a multiplayer platform and will be designed for a single player. This project is the first time I will be creating a GUI in my code. I had previously once coded a simple BlackJack game from which I am taking inspiration for this project. I am still looking over the necessary libraries and frameworks for this project and implementing a GUI.

## Code Overview:

### 1. Blackjack:

#### Game Description: Blackjack is a card game where the player's goal is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

#### Coding Process:

*Create a deck of 52 cards and shufle them.
*Implement functions for dealing cards to the player and the dealer.
*Calculate the value of the player's and dealer's hands.
*Implement player decisions (hit or stand(or split) and dealer's strategy.
*Determine the winner and adjust the player's balance accordingly.

### 2. Roulette:

#### Game Description: Roulette is a game of chance where the player  bets on the outcome of a spinning wheel with numbered pockets

#### Coding Process:

*Create a graphical representation of the roulette wheel.
*Implement a function to simulate the wheel spin and randomly determine the winning pocket.
*Allow the player to place bets on various outcomes (for example specific numbers, colors, odd/even).
*Calculate the player's winnings based on the bets placed and the winning pocket.

### 3. Slot Machine:
#### Game Description: The Slot Machine is a classic casino game where the player pulls a lever or presses a button to spin the reels, aiming to match symbols for a payout.

#### Coding Process:

*Design a graphical user interface (GUI) for the slot machine.
*Create a set of symbols and define winning combinations and payouts.
*Implement the spinning animation of the reels.
*Randomly generate the results and calculate the player's winnings based on the winning combinations.

##Features I would like to Implement:

*Implement a virtual wallet or balance for the player to track their money.
*Allow the player to place bets and adjust the balance after each game.
*Display the player's statistics and results for each game.
*Provide a simple menu for the player to choose between games.
