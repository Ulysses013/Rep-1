# Code Idea Description: Virtual Casino in Python

## Project Overview:

##### Hello! For the semester project, previously I had planned to write code for 3 Casino games : BlackJack, Roulette, Slots Machine and I also had decided to use GUI in the project. In due course of developing this game I have come to realization that the expected length of code for this project is met with just one game, therefore I have decided to code only for a BlackJack Game. I am using 'pygame' library for majority of rendering as I find it convenient.

## Code Overview:

### Blackjack:

#### Game Description: Blackjack is a card game where the player's goal is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

#### Coding Process:

* Create a deck of 52 cards and shufle them.
* Implement functions for dealing cards to the player and the dealer.
* Calculate the value of the player's and dealer's hands.
* Implement player decisions (hit or stand) and dealer's strategy.
* Determine the winner and adjust the player's balance accordingly.

## Features I would like to Implement:

* Implement a virtual wallet or balance for the player to track their money.
* Allow the player to place bets and adjust the balance after each game.
* Display the player's statistics and results for each game.
