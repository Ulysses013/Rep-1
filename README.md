# Software Development Project : Virtual Casino in Python

## Project Overview:

##### Hello! For the semester project, I have decided to code for a BlackJack Game. I am using 'pygame' library for majority of rendering.

## Code Overview:

### Blackjack:

#### Game Description: Blackjack is a card game where the player's goal is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

#### Coding Process:

* Create a deck of 52 cards and shufle them.
* Implement functions for dealing cards to the player and the dealer.
* Calculate the value of the player's and dealer's hands.
* Implement player decisions (hit or stand) and dealer's strategy.
* Determine the winner and adjust the player's balance accordingly.
